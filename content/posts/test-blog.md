# Getting Started with Node.js

Node.js is a powerful JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Here's how to get started:

1. Install Node.js from the official website.
2. Open your terminal and type `node -v` to check if it's installed correctly.
3. Create a new file called `app.js` and add the following code:

```javascript
console.log("Hello, Node.js!");
```

```python
print("hello world")
```

```bash
python main.py
```

4. Run the file by typing `node app.js` in your terminal.

Congratulations! You've just run your first Node.js program.
